To College Admissions officers:

_Foreword: the below message is generalized, and I may re-use this file. Please ignore
any parts of it that don't quite make sense due to variations in application formats._

I have provided this link to you in order to fulfill the portfolio upload requirement.
While you should of course feel free to look around at my various repositories, many
are small experiments or forks created for various pull requests. For this reason, you
may prefer to go through the "guided tour" of links I have provided in the text fields
earlier in the portfolio submission process. For your convenience, I will include these
answers again below (with clickable links this time, thanks to markdown).

I am submitting a number of programming projects, in no particular order. The "Upload" model doesn't really make sense for me because my code is hosted on Github, so I will provide links here.
These are some of the more interesting projects I could think of, but are certainly not an exhaustive list (many more experiments and projects are of course scattered around my filesystem and not publicly available).

1. GGET https://github.com/pachterlab/gget - "gget enables efficient querying of genomic reference databases"
2. Genome RSPY https://github.com/techno-sam/genome_rspy/ - a python frontend and optimized rust backend for indexing and sequence-aligning large sets of genetic data, used as ground truth to tune configurations for heuristic-based aligners
3. Tabula Historica https://techno-sam.github.io/tabula_historica/?showAbout - a flutter web app providing a labeled, timeline-scrubbable map of Ancient Rome, completed for a Latin final project
4. Discipulus https://github.com/techno-sam/discipulus/tree/main/lib - a dart program that uses Whittaker's Words to translate 1a-level Latin sentences into English. Uses hardcoded paths and expects a Whittaker's Words installation, so it may not be the easiest to run.
5. MSP430 Emulator https://github.com/techno-sam/msp430_emulator/ - inspired by the fantastic game Microcorruption, this is an ide, assembler, and emulator for the MSP430 chip.
6. Code Flow Tests https://github.com/techno-sam/code_flow_tests/blob/main/cfg_display_2.py - I uploaded this to Github for convenience, as it was developed in my private scratchpad repository. It implements a research paper by Yuri Stange to display directed (mainly-acyclic) graphs, optimized for control flow representation.
7. Advent of Code 2023 https://github.com/techno-sam/aoc_2023 - My solutions, in Rust, for Advent of Code 2023.
8. Steam 'n' Rails https://github.com/Layers-of-Railways/Railway - Minecraft mod extending the features of another mod's (Create's) railroad system through novel mechanics and building blocks. Downloads page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-steam-n-rails
9. Create: Numismatics https://github.com/Layers-of-Railways/CreateNumismatics - A currency mod for minecraft combining visual flair, ease-of-use, and deep automation capabilities. Downloads page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/numismatics
10. Phonos https://github.com/Layers-of-Railways/Phonos - A minecraft mod allowing players to create complex in-game sound systems.

Note: "sole author" applies to the code in the project itself and is not intended to mean that no external libraries were used (or snippets from other programs incorporated, though these are annotated in my code on a best-effort basis).

1. During a summer internship in the Pachter Lab (at Caltech), I developed several modules to interface with databases that hadn't been incorporated yet
2. Sole author, I implemented it independently from scratch during the aforementioned internship
3. Sole author.
4. Sole author.
5. Sole author (MSP430 language/ISA is not my own invention, but that of Texas Instruments)
6. Sole author of code, using research papers for algorithms (though I certainly had to significantly expand on some details to get a working system).
7. Sole author of code, most days solved without external help.
8. Co-lead programmer, I work with a team of roughly 16 people (mostly artists, with a few programmers)
9. Co-lead programmer, same team as #8
10. Recent maintainer. The original author had not updated the mod in a long time and I wanted a number of new features for a minecraft server I was involved with, so I created this fork. I have since reached out to the original author and we are planning to merge my features into the main mod (I will continue as a maintainer, and we will work together in terms of creative vision).
